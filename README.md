♻️ EcoVision-AI-Bin
EcoVision-AI-Bin is a smart waste management solution powered by Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. This project uses real-time image recognition to automatically detect, classify, and sort waste into categories like plastic, metal, paper, and organic, helping to promote sustainable living and eco-friendly practices.

🌍 Key Features
🧠 AI-Powered Waste Detection: Uses deep learning models to identify waste types from images or camera input.

📦 Smart Sorting System: Automatically directs waste to the appropriate bin based on classification.

📷 Real-Time Vision System: Processes live video feeds or images using computer vision.

💡 Eco-Friendly Design: Built to encourage efficient recycling and reduce landfill waste.

📊 Data Logging & Analytics (optional): Keeps track of waste types for environmental monitoring and reports.

🔧 Tech Stack
C++, TensorFloW

ESP32 (for hardware control,)

Flask / Streamlit (for optional UI or dashboard)

Deep Learning Models: CNN-based classifiers for image recognition

🚀 Applications
Smart bins in schools, offices, malls, and public spaces

Awareness tools for teaching sustainability and recycling

Scalable framework for IoT-based waste management systems
